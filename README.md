# ModX/Concrete5!Blesta

This repository contains the PHP code used to create and perform the integration of the ModX/Concrete5 CMS and the Blesta billing application.

This is a port of J!Blesta from Jooma to ModX/Concrete5

J!Blesta does require the Dunamis framework to function on both the Joomla side and the Blesta side.
